    Image retrieval methods rely on metric learning to train backbone feature extraction models that can extract discriminant queries and reference (gallery) feature representations for similarity matching. Although state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large datasets, image retrieval remains challenging in many real-world video analytics and surveillance applications, e.g., person re-identification. Using the Euclidean space for matching limits the performance in real-world applications due to the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and sensitivity to noisy data.   We argue that the feature dissimilarity space is more suitable for similarity matching, and propose a dichotomy transformation to project query and reference embeddings into a single embedding in the dissimilarity space.   We also advocate for end-to-end training of a backbone and binary classification models for pair-wise matching. As opposed to comparing the distance between queries and reference embeddings, we show the benefits of classifying the single dissimilarity space embedding (as similar or dissimilar), especially when trained end-to-end. We propose a method to train the max-margin classifier together with the backbone feature extractor by applying constraints to the L2 norm of the classifier weights along with the hinge loss.   Our extensive experiments on challenging image retrieval datasets and using diverse feature extraction backbones highlight the benefits of similarity matching in the dissimilarity space. In particular, when jointly training the feature extraction backbone and regularised classifier for matching, the dissimilarity space provides a higher level of accuracy.

    Visual localization aims to determine the camera pose of a query image relative to a database of posed images. In recent years, deep neural networks that directly regress camera poses have gained popularity due to their fast inference capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to either generalize well to new scenes or provide accurate camera pose estimates. To address these issues, we present \textbf{Reloc3r}, a simple yet effective visual localization framework. It consists of an elegantly designed relative pose regression network, and a minimalist motion averaging module for absolute pose estimation. Trained on approximately 8 million posed image pairs, Reloc3r achieves surprisingly good performance and generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 public datasets, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It provides high-quality camera pose estimates in real time and generalizes to novel scenes. Code, weights, and data at: \url{https://github.com/ffrivera0/reloc3r}.

    Natural language offers a convenient, flexible interface for controlling robotic C-arm X-ray systems, making advanced functionality and controls accessible. However, enabling language interfaces requires specialized AI models that interpret X-ray images to create a semantic representation for reasoning. The fixed outputs of such AI models limit the functionality of language controls. Incorporating flexible, language-aligned AI models prompted through language enables more versatile interfaces for diverse tasks and procedures. Using a language-aligned foundation model for X-ray image segmentation, our system continually updates a patient digital twin based on sparse reconstructions of desired anatomical structures. This supports autonomous capabilities such as visualization, patient-specific viewfinding, and automatic collimation from novel viewpoints, enabling commands 'Focus in on the lower lumbar vertebrae.' In a cadaver study, users visualized, localized, and collimated structures across the torso using verbal commands, achieving 84% end-to-end success. Post hoc analysis of randomly oriented images showed our patient digital twin could localize 35 commonly requested structures to within 51.68 mm, enabling localization and isolation from arbitrary orientations. Our results demonstrate how intelligent robotic X-ray systems can incorporate physicians' expressed intent directly. While existing foundation models for intra-operative X-ray analysis exhibit failure modes, as they improve, they can facilitate highly flexible, intelligent robotic C-arms.

    Flare, an optical phenomenon resulting from unwanted scattering and reflections within a lens system, presents a significant challenge in imaging. The diverse patterns of flares, such as halos, streaks, color bleeding, and haze, complicate the flare removal process. Existing traditional and learning-based methods have exhibited limited efficacy due to their reliance on single-image approaches, where flare removal is highly ill-posed. We address this by framing flare removal as a multi-view image problem, taking advantage of the view-dependent nature of flare artifacts. This approach leverages information from neighboring views to recover details obscured by flare in individual images. Our proposed framework, GN-FR (Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal), can render flare-free views from a sparse set of input images affected by lens flare and generalizes across different scenes in an unsupervised manner. GN-FR incorporates several modules within the Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT) framework: Flare-occupancy Mask Generation (FMG), View Sampler (VS), and Point Sampler (PS). To overcome the impracticality of capturing both flare-corrupted and flare-free data, we introduce a masking loss function that utilizes mask information in an unsupervised setting. Additionally, we present a 3D multi-view flare dataset, comprising 17 real flare scenes with 782 images, 80 real flare patterns, and their corresponding annotated flare-occupancy masks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address flare removal within a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) framework.

    Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references. An implementation of this paper are available at https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-NQA.
