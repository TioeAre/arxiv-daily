    In this paper, we propose a novel framework for speech-image retrieval. We utilize speech-image contrastive (SIC) learning tasks to align speech and image representations at a coarse level and speech-image matching (SIM) learning tasks to further refine the fine-grained cross-modal alignment. SIC and SIM learning tasks are jointly trained in a unified manner. To optimize the learning process, we utilize an embedding queue that facilitates efficient sampling of high-quality and diverse negative representations during SIC learning. Additionally, it enhances the learning of SIM tasks by effectively mining hard negatives based on contrastive similarities calculated in SIC tasks. To further optimize learning under noisy supervision, we incorporate momentum distillation into the training process. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 4% in R@1 on two benchmark datasets for the speech-image retrieval tasks. Moreover, as observed in zero-shot experiments, our framework demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities.
