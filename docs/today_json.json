This single-image calibration can benefit various downstream applications like image editing and 3D mapping. Current approaches to this problem are based on either classical geometry with lines and vanishing points or on deep neural networks trained end-to-end. The learned approaches are more robust but struggle to generalize to new environments and are less accurate than their classical counterparts. We hypothesize that they lack the constraints that 3D geometry provides. In this work, we introduce GeoCalib, a deep neural network that leverages universal rules of 3D geometry through an optimization process. GeoCalib is trained end-to-end to estimate camera parameters and learns to find useful visual cues from the data. Experiments on various benchmarks show that GeoCalib is more robust and more accurate than existing classical and learned approaches. Its internal optimization estimates uncertainties, which help flag failure cases and benefit downstream applications like visual localization.

Nevertheless, the substantial quantity of undeciphered OBI characters continues to pose a persistent challenge for scholars, while conventional methods of ancient script research are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a cross-font image retrieval network (CFIRN) to decipher OBI characters by establishing associations between OBI characters and other script forms, simulating the interpretive behavior of paleography scholars. Concretely, our network employs a siamese framework to extract deep features from character images of various fonts, fully exploring structure clues with different resolution by designed multiscale feature integration (MFI) module and multiscale refinement classifier (MRC). Extensive experiments on three challenging cross-font image retrieval datasets demonstrate that, given undeciphered OBI characters, our CFIRN can effectively achieve accurate matches with characters from other gallery fonts.", "paper_authors": "Zhicong Wu, Qifeng Su, Ke Gu, Xiaodong Shi", "update_time": "2024-09-10", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06381", "paper_id": "2409.06381", "code_url": null}}, "Image Matching": {"2409.06471": {"paper_title": "Weakly-supervised Camera Localization by Ground-to-satellite Image Registration", "paper_abstract": "The ground-to-satellite image matching/retrieval was initially proposed for city-scale ground camera localization.

However, extending NeRFs to model dynamic objects or object articulations remains a challenging problem. Previous works have tackled this issue by focusing on part-level reconstruction and motion estimation for objects, but they often rely on heuristics regarding the number of moving parts or object categories, which can limit their practical use. In this work, we introduce LEIA, a novel approach for representing dynamic 3D objects. Our method involves observing the object at distinct time steps or \"states\" and conditioning a hypernetwork on the current state, using this to parameterize our NeRF. This approach allows us to learn a view-invariant latent representation for each state. We further demonstrate that by interpolating between these states, we can generate novel articulation configurations in 3D space that were previously unseen. Our experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in articulating objects in a manner that is independent of the viewing angle and joint configuration. Notably, our approach outperforms previous methods that rely on motion information for articulation registration.", "paper_authors": "Archana Swaminathan, Anubhav Gupta, Kamal Gupta, Shishira R.

In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy that categorizes different sources of uncertainty inherent in these methods. Moreover, we extend NeRF- and GS-based methods with uncertainty estimation techniques, including learning uncertainty outputs and ensembles, and perform an empirical study to assess their ability to capture the sensitivity of the reconstruction.

Importantly, when reconstructing our clear NeRF, we consider the camera modeling imperfections that arise from the simple pinhole camera model as learned embeddings for each camera measurement, and further learn a mapper that connects event camera measurements with RGB data. As no previous dataset exists for our binocular setting, we introduce an event camera dataset with captures from a 3D-printed stereo configuration between RGB and event cameras. Empirically, we evaluate our introduced dataset and EVIMOv2 and show that our method leads to improved reconstructions.
