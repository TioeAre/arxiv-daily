Currently, fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense registration algorithms for further performance improvements.", "paper_authors": "Yuwei Jia, Zhe Cui, Fei Su", "update_time": "2025-07-22", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16201", "paper_id": "2507.16201", "code_url": null}}, "NeRF": {"2507.16406": {"paper_title": "Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction: Recent Advances and Open Challenges", "paper_abstract": "Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous systems.
