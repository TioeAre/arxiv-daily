Triangulation - the task of estimating a 3D point from noisy 2D projections across multiple images - is a fundamental problem in multiview geometry and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. We apply our framework to the two-view case and demonstrate that optimal triangulation, which requires solving a univariate polynomial of degree six, can be simplified through cost function reweighting reducing the polynomial degree to two. This reweighting yields a closed-form solution while preserving strong geometric accuracy. We derive optimal weighting strategies, establish theoretical bounds on the approximation error, and provide experimental results on real data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to standard methods. Although this work focuses on two-view triangulation, the framework generalizes to other geometric vision problems.", "paper_authors": "Felix Rydell, Georg B\u00f6kman, Fredrik Kahl, Kathl\u00e9n Kohn", "update_time": "2025-03-11", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08142", "paper_id": "2503.08142", "code_url": null}}, "Visual Localization": {"2503.08170": {"paper_title": "CQVPR: Landmark-aware Contextual Queries for Visual Place Recognition", "paper_abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to estimate the location of the given query image within a database of geo-tagged images. To identify the exact location in an image, detecting landmarks is crucial. However, in some scenarios, such as urban environments, there are numerous landmarks, such as various modern buildings, and the landmarks in different cities often exhibit high visual similarity. Therefore, it is essential not only to leverage the landmarks but also to consider the contextual information surrounding them, such as whether there are trees, roads, or other features around the landmarks. We propose the Contextual Query VPR (CQVPR), which integrates contextual information with detailed pixel-level visual features. By leveraging a set of learnable contextual queries, our method automatically learns the high-level contexts with respect to landmarks and their surrounding areas. Heatmaps depicting regions that each query attends to serve as context-aware features, offering cues that could enhance the understanding of each scene. We further propose a query matching loss to supervise the extraction process of contextual queries.

Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first NeRF/3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI and KITTI 360 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories.

The evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing NeRF-based initialization solution in both accuracy and efficiency. By integrating a two-stage update mechanism within a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the state of NeRF-VIO is constrained by both captured images from an onboard camera and rendered images from a pre-trained NeRF model.

Our system renders a 2D view of a 3D scene with a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and visualizes the gaze field for arbitrary observer positions, which may be decoupled from the render camera perspective. We achieve this by augmenting a standard NeRF with an additional neural network that models the gaze probability distribution. The output of a NeRG is a rendered image of the scene viewed from the camera perspective and a pixel-wise salience map representing conditional probability that an observer fixates on a given surface within the 3D scene as visible in the rendered image. Much like how NeRFs perform novel view synthesis, NeRGs enable the reconstruction of gaze patterns from arbitrary perspectives within complex 3D scenes. To ensure consistent gaze reconstructions, we constrain gaze prediction on the 3D structure of the scene and model gaze occlusion due to intervening surfaces when the observer's viewpoint is decoupled from the rendering camera. For training, we leverage ground truth head pose data from skeleton tracking data or predictions from 2D salience models.
