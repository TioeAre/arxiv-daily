Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) model scenes as continuous volumetric functions and achieve remarkable rendering quality.

To overcome this limitation, prior work has integrated geometric constraints into the NeRF pipeline, typically leveraging depth information derived from Structure from Motion or Multi-View Stereo.

The sparse multi-maps are adequate for robust camera localization, however they are very poor for environment representation, they are noisy, with a high percentage of inaccurately reconstructed 3D points, including significant outliers, and more importantly with an unacceptable low density for clinical applications.   We propose a method to remove outliers and densify the maps of the state of the art for sparse endoscopy multi-map CudaSIFT-SLAM. The NN LightDepth for up-to-scale depth dense predictions are aligned with the sparse CudaSIFT submaps by means of the robust to spurious LMedS. Our system mitigates the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation while filtering outliers, leading to reliable densified 3D maps.

This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models.

Our approach extends ZipNeRF and utilizes Grounded SAM for segmentation mask generation, enabling effective handling of transient objects, modeling of the sky, and regularization of the ground.
