Similarly, recent advances in neural radiance fields and its variants also primarily address opaque objects, encountering difficulties with the complex lighting effects caused by transparent materials. This paper introduces $\\alpha$-NeuS, a new method for simultaneously reconstructing thin transparent objects and opaque objects based on neural implicit surfaces (NeuS). Our method leverages the observation that transparent surfaces induce local extreme values in the learned distance fields during neural volumetric rendering, contrasting with opaque surfaces that align with zero level sets. Traditional iso-surfacing algorithms such as marching cubes, which rely on fixed iso-values, are ill-suited for this data. We address this by taking the absolute value of the distance field and developing an optimization method that extracts level sets corresponding to both non-negative local minima and zero iso-values. We prove that the reconstructed surfaces are unbiased for both transparent and opaque objects. To validate our approach, we construct a benchmark that includes both real-world and synthetic scenes, demonstrating its practical utility and effectiveness.

Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.", "paper_authors": "Zongcheng Zuo, Yuanxiang Li, Tongtong Zhang", "update_time": "2024-11-08", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures, The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing\n  Symposium (IGARSS2023)", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05557", "paper_id": "2411.05557", "code_url": null}, "2411.05322": {"paper_title": "Rate-aware Compression for NeRF-based Volumetric Video", "paper_abstract": "The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.", "paper_authors": "Zhiyu Zhang, Guo Lu, Huanxiong Liang, Zhengxue Cheng, Anni Tang, Li Song", "update_time": "2024-11-08", "comments": "Accepted by ACM MM 2024 (Oral)", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05322", "paper_id": "2411.05322", "code_url": null}}}
