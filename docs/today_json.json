Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous changes, have gained significant attention for their potential in feature tracking, especially in challenging conditions. However, event cameras lack the fine-grained texture information that conventional cameras provide, leading to error accumulation in tracking. To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with RGB images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking, resolves ambiguities, and supports asynchronous data fusion. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing event-based methods, exceeding 100 FPS with preprocessed event data and 80 FPS with multi-modality data.", "paper_authors": "Yichen Shen, Yijin Li, Shuo Chen, Guanglin Li, Zhaoyang Huang, Hujun Bao, Zhaopeng Cui, Guofeng Zhang", "update_time": "2024-09-26", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17981", "paper_id": "2409.17981", "code_url": null}}}
