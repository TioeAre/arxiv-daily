This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.", "paper_authors": "Kiarash Naghavi Khanghah, Zhiling Chen, Lela Romeo, Qian Yang, Rajiv Malhotra, Farhad Imani, Hongyi Xu", "update_time": "2025-05-20", "comments": "ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and\n  Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August\n  17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13828", "paper_id": "2505.13828", "code_url": null}}, "NeRF": {"2505.13633": {"paper_title": "IPENS:Interactive Unsupervised Framework for Rapid Plant Phenotyping Extraction via NeRF-SAM2 Fusion", "paper_abstract": "Advanced plant phenotyping technologies play a crucial role in targeted trait improvement and accelerating intelligent breeding. Due to the species diversity of plants, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale high-precision manually annotated data. For self-occluded objects at the grain level, unsupervised methods often prove ineffective. This study proposes IPENS, an interactive unsupervised multi-target point cloud extraction method. The method utilizes radiance field information to lift 2D masks, which are segmented by SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2), into 3D space for target point cloud extraction. A multi-target collaborative optimization strategy is designed to effectively resolve the single-interaction multi-target segmentation challenge. Experimental validation demonstrates that IPENS achieves a grain-level segmentation accuracy (mIoU) of 63.72% on a rice dataset, with strong phenotypic estimation capabilities: grain volume prediction yields R2 = 0.7697 (RMSE = 0.0025), leaf surface area R2 = 0.84 (RMSE = 18.93), and leaf length and width predictions achieve R2 = 0.97 and 0.87 (RMSE = 1.49 and 0.21). On a wheat dataset,IPENS further improves segmentation accuracy to 89.68% (mIoU), with equally outstanding phenotypic estimation performance: spike volume prediction achieves R2 = 0.9956 (RMSE = 0.0055), leaf surface area R2 = 1.00 (RMSE = 0.67), and leaf length and width predictions reach R2 = 0.99 and 0.92 (RMSE = 0.23 and 0.15). This method provides a non-invasive, high-quality phenotyping extraction solution for rice and wheat. Without requiring annotated data, it rapidly extracts grain-level point clouds within 3 minutes through simple single-round interactions on images for multiple targets, demonstrating significant potential to accelerate intelligent breeding efficiency.", "paper_authors": "Wentao Song, He Huang, Youqiang Sun, Fang Qu, Jiaqi Zhang, Longhui Fang, Yuwei Hao, Chenyang Peng", "update_time": "2025-05-19", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13633", "paper_id": "2505.13633", "code_url": null}}}
