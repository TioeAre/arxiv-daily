We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on 28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S., South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based clinical research.", "paper_authors": "Cheng Wang, Yu Jiang, Zhihao Peng, Chenxin Li, Changbae Bang, Lin Zhao, Jinglei Lv, Jorge Sepulcre, Carl Yang, Lifang He, Tianming Liu, Daniel Barron, Quanzheng Li, Randy Hirschtick, Byung-Hoon Kim, Xiang Li, Yixuan Yuan", "update_time": "2025-06-11", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11167", "paper_id": "2506.11167", "code_url": null}}}
