The core idea is not only to do SfM for egocentric videos but also to do 2D-3D matching between existing 3D scans and 2D video frames. In this way, we have a hybrid SfM and camera relocalization pipeline, which can provide us with more camera poses, leading to higher QwP and overall success rate. Our method achieves the best performance regarding the most important metric, the overall success rate. We surpass previous state-of-the-art, the competitive EgoLoc, by $1.5\\%$.

This research introduces a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) integrity monitor for VPR which demonstrates improved performance and generalizability over the previous state-of-the-art SVM approach, removing per-environment training and reducing manual tuning requirements. We test our proposed system in extensive real-world experiments, where we also present two real-time integrity-based VPR verification methods: an instantaneous rejection method for a robot navigating to a goal zone (Experiment 1); and a historical method that takes a best, verified, match from its recent trajectory and uses an odometer to extrapolate forwards to a current position estimate (Experiment 2). Noteworthy results for Experiment 1 include a decrease in aggregate mean along-track goal error from ~9.8m to ~3.1m in missions the robot pursued to completion, and an increase in the aggregate rate of successful mission completion from ~41% to ~55%. Experiment 2 showed a decrease in aggregate mean along-track localization error from ~2.0m to ~0.5m, and an increase in the aggregate precision of localization attempts from ~97% to ~99%.

However, in clinical practice, the continuously expanding size of WSI databases limits the practical application of the current CBHIR methods. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on continuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the balance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To preserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir sampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the feature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency rehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency for previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR system.

The first step determines whether loop closing should be performed, while the second estimates the 6-DoF pose to correct odometry drift. Current methods mostly focus on developing robust descriptors for loop closure detection, often neglecting loop pose estimation. A few methods that do include pose estimation either suffer from low accuracy or incur high computational costs. To tackle this problem, we introduce SGLC, a real-time semantic graph-guided full loop closing method, with robust loop closure detection and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. SGLC takes into account the distinct characteristics of foreground and background points. For foreground instances, it builds a semantic graph that not only abstracts point cloud representation for fast descriptor generation and matching but also guides the subsequent loop verification and initial pose estimation. Background points, meanwhile, are exploited to provide more geometric features for scan-wise descriptor construction and stable planar information for further pose refinement. Loop pose estimation employs a coarse-fine-refine registration scheme that considers the alignment of both instance points and background points, offering high efficiency and accuracy. We evaluate the loop closing performance of SGLC through extensive experiments on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we integrate SGLC into a SLAM system, eliminating accumulated errors and improving overall SLAM performance.

NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

To overcome these limitations, our method represents the avatar with an explicit triangular mesh extracted from an implicit SDF field, complemented by an implicit material field conditioned on given poses. Leveraging this triangular avatar representation, we incorporate physics-based rendering to accurately decompose geometry and texture. To enhance both the geometric and appearance details, we further employ a 2D UNet as the network backbone and introduce pseudo normal ground-truth as additional supervision.

Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit_NeRF_QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric.

As an extension of conventional NeRFs in underwater environment, where light can get absorbed and scattered by water, SeaThru-NeRF was proposed to separate the clean appearance and geometric structure of underwater scene from the effects of the scattering medium. Since the quality of the appearance and structure of underwater scenes is crucial for downstream tasks such as underwater infrastructure inspection, the reliability of the 3D reconstruction model should be considered and evaluated. Nonetheless, owing to the lack of ability to quantify uncertainty in 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes under natural ambient illumination, the practical deployment of NeRFs in unmanned autonomous underwater navigation is limited. To address this issue, we introduce a spatial perturbation field D_omega based on Bayes' rays in SeaThru-NeRF and perform Laplace approximation to obtain a Gaussian distribution N(0,Sigma) of the parameters omega, where the diagonal elements of Sigma correspond to the uncertainty at each spatial location.
