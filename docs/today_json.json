Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.", "paper_authors": "Jizong Peng, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Kai Xu, Wenchao Gao, Angela Yao", "update_time": "2025-04-12", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09129", "paper_id": "2504.09129", "code_url": null}}, "Visual Localization": {"2504.09881": {"paper_title": "Focus on Local: Finding Reliable Discriminative Regions for Visual Place Recognition", "paper_abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is aimed at predicting the location of a query image by referencing a database of geotagged images. For VPR task, often fewer discriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while mundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing because of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and full exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose the Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image retrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting reliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing pseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses, Extraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background Contrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative local regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations and efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local feature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from aggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences ground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking pipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region guidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and re-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR methods in terms of computational efficiency.

As those mask patterns resort to different criteria to depict image contents, sticking to a fixed pattern leads to a limited vision cues modeling capability.This paper introduces an evolved hierarchical masking method to pursue general visual cues modeling in self-supervised learning. The proposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input visual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate masks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of the model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training stages. Initially, generated masks focus on low-level visual cues to grasp basic textures, then gradually evolve to depict higher-level cues to reinforce the learning of more complicated object semantics and contexts. Our method does not require extra pre-trained models or annotations and ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks including partial-duplicate image retrieval relying on low-level details, as well as image classification and semantic segmentation that require semantic parsing capability. Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially boosts performance across these tasks. For instance, it surpasses the recent MAE by 1.1\\% in imageNet-1K classification and 1.4\\% in ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs. We also align the proposed method with the current research focus on LLMs. The proposed approach bridges the gap with large-scale pre-training on semantic demanding tasks and enhances intricate detail perception in tasks requiring low-level feature recognition.", "paper_authors": "Zhanzhou Feng, Shiliang Zhang", "update_time": "2025-04-12", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09155", "paper_id": "2504.09155", "code_url": null}, "2504.08901": {"paper_title": "HAL-NeRF: High Accuracy Localization Leveraging Neural Radiance Fields", "paper_abstract": "Precise camera localization is a critical task in XR applications and robotics.

While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian.

However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting, requires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by multimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient sampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing point-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit) and complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling algorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel level), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different texture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into pixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically, the trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost the initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes the block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source toolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other ray-sampling algorithms.

Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems.
