In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models.

In this work, we present a novel unsupervised registration pipeline that entirely eliminates the need for labeled data.

Compared with conventional RGB images, lidar imagery demonstrates greater robustness in adverse environmental conditions, such as low light and foggy weather.

The enhanced lidar images, enriched with additional information, facilitate improved keypoint detection, which is subsequently employed for more effective point cloud downsampling.

The simplicity of parametric mesh structures is appealing, but the underlying issue is that it binds methods to mesh initialization, making it unable to generalize to objects where a parametric model does not exist. It also means that estimation is tied to mesh resolution and the accuracy of mesh fitting. This paper presents a pipeline for meshless 3D rendering, which we apply to the hands. By providing only a 3D skeleton, the desired appearance is extracted via a convolutional model. We do this by exploiting a NeRF renderer conditioned upon an occupancy-based representation.

In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decomposes scenes and allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is co-optimized with the experts, by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene parts.
