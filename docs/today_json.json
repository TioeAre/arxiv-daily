Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence. It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment.

However, failures of camera pose tracking are frequently witnessed in state-of-the-art event-based visual odometry systems when the local map cannot be updated in time. One of the biggest roadblocks for this specific field is the absence of efficient and robust methods for data association without imposing any assumption on the environment. This problem seems, however, unlikely to be addressed as in standard vision due to the motion-dependent observability of event data. Therefore, we propose a mapping-free design for event-based visual-inertial state estimation in this paper. Instead of estimating the position of the event camera, we find that recovering the instantaneous linear velocity is more consistent with the differential working principle of event cameras.

Accurate relative positioning is necessary to successfully carry out a collaborative mission without collisions. When Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is used to estimate the poses of each robot, inter-agent loop closing is widely applied to reduce the relative positioning errors. This technique can mitigate errors using the feature points commonly observed by different robots. However, it requires significant computing and communication capabilities to detect inter-agent loops, and to process the data transmitted by multiple agents. In this paper, we propose Collaborative SLAM using Visual Odometry and Range measurements (CoVOR-SLAM) to overcome this challenge. In the framework of CoVOR-SLAM, robots only need to exchange pose estimates, covariances (uncertainty) of the estimates, and range measurements between robots. Since CoVOR-SLAM does not require to associate visual features and map points observed by different agents, the computational and communication loads are significantly reduced. The required range measurements can be obtained using pilot signals of the communication system, without requiring complex additional infrastructure.

Obtaining the pose from a single image enables many robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. Inspired by latest advances in deep learning, many existing approaches directly learn and regress 6 DoF pose from an input image. However, these methods do not fully utilize the underlying scene geometry for pose regression. The challenge in monocular relocalization is the minimal availability of supervised training data, which is just the corresponding 6 DoF poses of the images. In this paper, we propose to utilize these minimal available labels (.i.e, poses) to learn the underlying 3D geometry of the scene and use the geometry to estimate the 6 DoF camera pose. We present a learning method that uses these pose labels and rigid alignment to learn two 3D geometric representations (\\textit{X, Y, Z coordinates}) of the scene, one in camera coordinate frame and the other in global coordinate frame. Given a single image, it estimates these two 3D scene representations, which are then aligned to estimate a pose that matches the pose label. This formulation allows for the active inclusion of additional learning constraints to minimize 3D alignment errors between the two 3D scene representations, and 2D re-projection errors between the 3D global scene representation and 2D image pixels, resulting in improved localization accuracy. During inference, our model estimates the 3D scene geometry in camera and global frames and aligns them rigidly to obtain pose in real-time.

However, the existing ZS-CIR methods show limited backbone scalability and generalizability due to the lack of diversity of the input texts during training. We propose a novel CIR framework, only using language for its training. Our LinCIR (Language-only training for CIR) can be trained only with text datasets by a novel self-supervision named self-masking projection (SMP). We project the text latent embedding to the token embedding space and construct a new text by replacing the keyword tokens of the original text. Then, we let the new and original texts have the same latent embedding vector. With this simple strategy, LinCIR is surprisingly efficient and highly effective; LinCIR with CLIP ViT-G backbone is trained in 48 minutes and shows the best ZS-CIR performances on four different CIR benchmarks, CIRCO, GeneCIS, FashionIQ, and CIRR, even outperforming supervised method on FashionIQ.

Yet, current medical VLP methods face challenges in learning these fine-grained features, as they primarily focus on brute-force alignment between image patches and individual text tokens for local visual feature learning, which is suboptimal for downstream dense prediction tasks.

Our method utilizes the output heatmaps and intermediate feature maps from a keypoint detection network to guide the segmentation process. We introduce the TriDental dataset, consisting of 3000 oral cavity images annotated with teeth keypoints, to train a teeth keypoint detection network. We combine feature maps from different layers of the keypoint detection network, enabling accurate teeth segmentation without explicit segmentation annotations. The detected keypoints are also used for further refinement of the segmentation masks.

Compared with photogrammetric reconstruction method, NeRF has significant advantages in reconstruction efficiency and is adaptable to complex scenes, but the generated point cloud tends to be noisy and low resolution. The accuracy of tree structural parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height) extracted from the photogrammetric point cloud is still higher than those of derived from the NeRF point cloud. The results of this study illustrate the great potential of NeRF method for individual tree reconstruction, and it provides new ideas and research directions for 3D reconstruction and visualization of complex forest scenes.", "paper_authors": "Hongyu Huang, Guoji Tian, Chongcheng Chen", "update_time": "2023-12-06", "comments": "25 pages; 6 figures", "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03372", "paper_id": "2312.03372", "code_url": null}}}
