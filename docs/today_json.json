In this context, medical image retrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a vital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing methods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to produce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive hashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image retrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create positive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate knowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the knowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF) and Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates shallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates image fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings. These blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based recommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment. Moreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and reproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and significantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval (p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean Average Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.", "paper_authors": "Yang Nan, Huichi Zhou, Xiaodan Xing, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Lei Zhu, Zhifan Gao, Alejandro F Fangi, Guang Yang", "update_time": "2025-03-12", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09370", "paper_id": "2503.09370", "code_url": null}}, "NeRF": {"2503.09464": {"paper_title": "Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation", "paper_abstract": "Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.", "paper_authors": "M\u00e1t\u00e9 T\u00f3th, P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs, Zolt\u00e1n Bendefy, Zolt\u00e1n Hortsin, Bal\u00e1zs Ter\u00e9ki, Tam\u00e1s Matuszka", "update_time": "2025-03-12", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464", "paper_id": "2503.09464", "code_url": null}}}
