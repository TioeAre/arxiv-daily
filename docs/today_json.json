Using structure-from-motion (SfM) as a benchmark for 3D tasks, we investigate if intermediate features from OpenSora, a video generation model, can support camera pose estimation. We first examine native 3D awareness in video generation features by routing raw intermediate outputs to SfM-prediction modules like DUSt3R. Then, we explore the impact of fine-tuning on camera pose estimation to enhance 3D awareness. Results indicate that while video generator features have limited inherent 3D awareness, task-specific supervision significantly boosts their accuracy for camera pose estimation, resulting in competitive performance. The proposed unified model, named JOG3R, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality without degrading video generation quality.", "paper_authors": "Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Jae Shin Yoon, Hyeonho Jeong, Niloy Mitra, Duygu Ceylan", "update_time": "2025-01-02", "comments": null, "paper_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01409", "paper_id": "2501.01409", "code_url": null}, "2501.01003": {"paper_title": "EasySplat: View-Adaptive Learning makes 3D Gaussian Splatting Easy", "paper_abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have achieved satisfactory 3D scene representation. Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling.

Current methods incorporate monocular priors into neural implicit surface models to achieve high-quality reconstructions. However, these methods require hundreds of images for scene reconstruction. When only a limited number of views are available as input, the performance of monocular priors deteriorates due to scale ambiguity, leading to the collapse of the reconstructed scene geometry. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Sparis, for indoor surface reconstruction from sparse views. Specifically, we investigate the impact of monocular priors on sparse scene reconstruction, introducing a novel prior based on inter-image matching information. Our prior offers more accurate depth information while ensuring cross-view matching consistency. Additionally, we employ an angular filter strategy and an epipolar matching weight function, aiming to reduce errors due to view matching inaccuracies, thereby refining the inter-image prior for improved reconstruction accuracy.
